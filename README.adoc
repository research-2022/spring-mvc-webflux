Execution failed for task ':bookstore-mvc-shared:compileJava'.
> Could not create service of type DefaultGeneralCompileCaches using GradleScopeCompileServices.createGeneralCompileCaches().
   > Cannot lock Java compile cache (/[workspace]/spring-mvc-and-webflux/.gradle/6.7-20200804220106+0000/javaCompile) as it has already been locked by this process.
